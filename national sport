    <p>The word <i>sauna</i> itself is of Finnish origin. One of the most important parts of life in Finland is the sauna. There is nothing more Finnish than a sauna. In a country of approximately 5 million people, there are an estimated 3 million saunas.</p>
    <p>In Finnish culture, sauna is thought of as a place that keeps people healthy. It relieves stress and has many proven health benefits. Sauna is good.</p>
    <p>One time, I tried to turn my bathroom into a sauna. For the steam, I turned the water on as hot as it could and shut off the vent and closed the window to trap the steam. I even put a towel under the door so no water could seep out. For the hot stones, I managed to secure some garden rocks. As well as a portable butane stove and a frying pan. This proved ineffective, because the rocks refused to come up to temp. I had to resort to burning toilet paper in the pan to raise the temperature of the room. I would reccomend actually going to Finland.</p>
    <p>You'll be sweating heavily in a sauna, so be sure to drink plenty. Water is the best thing to quench your thirst, but beer, cider and soft drinks are also commonly enjoyed. If you get hungry, cooking sausages either on the open fire or in tin foil directly on the stove is another key part of the sauna experience.</p>
