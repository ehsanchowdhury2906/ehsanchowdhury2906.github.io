    <p><i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</i>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.</p>
    <p>Many people associate the Northern Lights with winter, but the most active seasons are actually autumn and spring. This is when the earth's orientation towards the sun maximizes the probability of solar flares interacting with the planet's magnetic field, which creates this mesmerizing phenomenon. Statistically, the lights are visible on every second night.</p>
    <p>The skies must be dark and cloudless for northern lights sightings. The likelihood of seeing the auroras is close to zero when it rains or snows, because clouds are covering the skies. Luckily, there are many websites, even apps, available that alert users when the auroras are visible in your area when visiting Finland. </p>
